<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Shahid Guimba Tatak, but people call me Harris because that’s my first name before it was changed. I’m 20 years old and currently residing in Taguig City, where I am also pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I am currently a third-year college student in the A2020section.

  I have been living here in Metro Manila for 5 years. I grew up in the province with my grandma and disabled uncle, and had a peaceful life with them. I only came here in 2018 when I was in grade 11 to continue my studies. I now live with my biological parents. It’s painful to be apart from my grandma because she took care of me since I was a child. I really miss them.</p>
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>Among my favorite hobbies are painting landscapes, pondering over nature, and also being alone all the time. I find solace in observing the beauty surrounding us, whether it’s a sunset over the mountains or the delicate petals of a flower. Reading books, writing and learning Arabic are also important to me. I love to immerse myself in different worlds and perspectives, and writing allows me to express my thoughts and emotions.

    In my free time, I love engaging in historical documentaries and books. There is something captivating about exploring the past and learning about the roots of our world. I find it fascinating to gain insight into the cultures, events and individuals who shaped the world we live in today. This hobby allows me to connect with the past and enhances my understanding of the present.
    
     
    
    Cooking is another passion of mine. It’s a way for me to express my creativity in a different form, through the combination of flavors and ingredients. Trying out new recipes and experimenting with different techniques is always exciting.</p>
    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>When it comes to sports, I love playing badminton, swimming, and volleyball. Badminton requires agility and strategy, as well as quick reflexes. Swimming is a full-body workout that allows me to improve my strength and endurance while enjoying the water. Volleyball is a team sport that requires communication, coordination, and quick thinking.

    </p>
    <p>Overall, my hobbies and sports give me a sense of fulfillment and purpose. They allow me to explore my interests, learn new things, and challenge myself both physically and mentally, all while having fun.</p>
